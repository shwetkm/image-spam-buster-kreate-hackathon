Problem Statement by : <a href="https://www.mall91.com">Mall91</a>

Description

Build a "Spam Buster" for user generated IMAGE content based on predefined text, links
identified as "known bads", based on which the image should be classified as spam or
not-spam. The "known bads" can be updated anytime.

The "Spam Buster" would need to analyze at image level, identify text components inside image
and build appropriate logic to give a score to the image.

A similar use case is employed by Facebook Ads technology to identify if the image ad contains
too much text or contains any objectionable text."
