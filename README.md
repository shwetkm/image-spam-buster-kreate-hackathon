Problem Statement by : <a href="https://www.mall91.com">Mall91</a>

## Description

Build a "Spam Buster" for user generated IMAGE content which includes promotional texts containing images, vulgar images,etc.

The "Spam Buster" would need to analyze at image level, identify text components inside image
and build appropriate logic to give a score to the image.

A similar use case is employed by Facebook Ads technology to identify if the image ad contains
too much text or contains any objectionable text."
